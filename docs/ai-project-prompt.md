# Chrome Extension Project Specification

## Project Overview
Create a complete Chrome Extension using React, TypeScript (strict mode), and Vite with the following specifications:

## Selected Features
- Side Window (detached pop-out, ChatGPT-style): Opens in a dedicated side window, not injected into the page.
  - Use a background script to call chrome.windows.create({ url: "window.html", type: "popup", width: 400, height: 800 })
  - The main extension action should only be a launcher, not the full UI.
  - Do NOT inject a UI overlay into the current page.

## Required Files and Structure

### Core Configuration
- `manifest.json` (Manifest V3)
- `package.json` with all necessary dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` (TypeScript strict mode)
- `vite.config.ts` (Vite configuration for Chrome Extension)
- `.env.example` (environment variables template)
- `.gitignore` (appropriate exclusions)

### Source Code Structure
- `src/popup/Popup.tsx` (React popup component)
- `src/popup/popup.html` (popup HTML entry)
- `src/background/background.ts` (service worker)
- `src/content/content.ts` (content script)
- `src/utils/` (utility functions)

### Styling
- Basic CSS styling (See design-system.md

### Internationalization
- No i18n required

### Development Tools
- ESLint configuration
- Prettier configuration
- Testing setup (Vitest)
- Build scripts (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run zip`)

## Extension Modes

- Popup UI (in `src/popup/`) with example state persisted via `chrome.storage.sync`
- Detached Window UI (in `src/window/`) launched from popup, with message passing
- Optional Options page with settings persisted to chosen storage

## Dev Tooling

- Vite-powered HMR
- Scripts: `clean`, `dev`, `build`, `zip`
- Module path aliases like `@components`, `@utils`, `@popup`
- Auto-copy static assets to `dist/`

## Permissions & Security

- Scaffold only necessary permissions in `manifest.json`
- Dynamic permission utilities
- Baseline Content Security Policy configured

## Testing

- Vitest or Jest setup
- Mock Chrome APIs for UI testing
- Unit and integration test examples for UI, background, auth flows, messaging

## Documentation Requirements

Include these files:

- `docs/ai-changelogs.md`  
  Log of AI-generated feature changes, grouped by date and issue/feature.

- `docs/ai-troubleshooting.md`  
  Troubleshooting history (grouped by issue type + date). Additive only, newest at top.

- `docs/prd.md`  
  Product requirements doc. AI will mark items âœ… when completed, and update notes.

- `docs/design-system.md`  
  A modern, themeable design system tailored for **Chrome Extensions**, including:
  - Color tokens with light/dark mode (toggle capability)
  - Suggested emotion-based palettes
  - CSS variables for typography, spacing, radius, shadows, etc
  - Button, modal, card, form style
  - Create base components that can be inherited or extended
  - CSS folder structure (`/styles/`)
  - Popup/window layout support
  - Prompts you can use with an AI to scaffold design components

- `docs/recipes.md`
  Cookbook of common extension patterns, such as:
  - Messaging between popup and background
  - Dynamic content script injection
  - Debugging extension UI locally
  - Handling permissions dynamically
  - How to reset or inspect `chrome.storage`

## Accessibility & UX
- Keyboard navigable components
- Focus traps in modals
- Custom alert/notification system with ARIA support
- Optional theme toggler (light/dark/high-contrast)

## README.md Requirements
- Project intro
- CLI usage
- Dev/build instructions
- Chrome loading instructions
- File structure explanation

## Bonus Features
- Zip uploader CLI command
- AI-aware design guidelines for future extensions

## Requirements
- All files must include inline `// TODO`, `// CONFIGURE`, or `// REMOVE IF UNUSED` comments
- Use React 18+ with TypeScript strict mode
- Follow Chrome Extension Manifest V3 best practices
- Include proper error handling and accessibility features
- Add comprehensive documentation in `docs/` directory
